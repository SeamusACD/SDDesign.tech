About me

My name is Seamus Donaldson. I'm from Cambridge Mass. I was born and grew up in the house I've lived in my whole life. I have two brothers, a mom and a dad. And, before coming to Drexel I was a student at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. It was there that I found my passion for digital media, and graphic design. I started off learning the basics like photoshop and illustrator. I also got to know InDesign in high school, but for the most part what we created was static. While I have always enjoyed art and graphics, I knew that there was more of my mind that I could access and use for this type of work.

Part of the reason I came to Drexel was because I found out how. Or, at least Troy made it seem like it. When I was described the Interactive Digital Media major, I knew I was in the right place. While listening to the presentation on the major I had visions, and ideas of all the things I could do with the major.

My interests go beyond the computer screen and the code, so with the IDM major I felt that I could bring myself in along with my other interests, and cultivate something new and creative while combining it all. The ability to design is one thing, but the ability to design with intention, and purpose so that each interaction a user has with your creation is seamless and enjoyable is a whole different game.

My hopes are that over the next few years I really learn every last thing I can about what goes into designing user interfaces, creating pleasurable user experiences, and how to collaborate with a team to do those things.

Aside from my interest in digital media, and graphic design; I'd say I'm a pretty chill person. I'm very observational. I like music, although I don't know the lyrics or names of songs. I love playing pretty much any kind of sport. I have a house on cape cod where I vacation every summer. I want a dog, but my dad really doesn't. I enjoy going to the beach with my family and friends. And, I like having conversations.
