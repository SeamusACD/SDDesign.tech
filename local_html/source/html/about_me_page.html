			My story

			<p>
				My name is Seamus Donaldson, and I’m a college student at Drexel University studying interactive digital media. In the time that I’ve been here, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting people from all over the world, and have enjoyed sharing the new cultures they’ve brought with them. I’ve gotten a taste of what independence is really like and, I’ve also gotten really bad food poisoning from the dining hall… twice.

				While I have become quite fond of Philadelphia, my roots are in Cambridge. I grew up in north, about five minutes by foot from Alewife, and fifteen from Harvard. I went to the Peabody elementary school on rindge ave as a kid, and after that went on to attend the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, which is where my story really begins.</p>

				It wasn’t until sophomore year that I had the opportunity to take elective courses, and had it not been for my dad persuading me for a solid thirty minutes to take creative design 1 instead of carpentry, I’m not sure I’d be writing this letter. So, I added the course to my sophomore year schedule and forgot about it, until I walked into Ms. Max’s class the next fall. I immediately was inspired by the environment I was in; work students had done in past projects took up every inch of wall space in the classroom, and I loved it. Creativity was literally oozing from the walls, pinging thousands of ideas in my mind for new designs just by doing a three sixty degree turn to see all that’d been done before me. That year, and for two consecutive full years after, I took creative design, which was the name she gave the course which primarily focused on teaching graphic design skills. </p>

				I found my passion for design through Ms. Max. She taught me Illustrator, Photoshop, and Indesign, all programs that I am very confident in using now. I began building my portfolio, adding to it each time we finished a big project, and used it my junior year summer to land an internship at the East Cambridge Savings Bank in their marketing department running ad campaigns while collaborating with the rest of the marketing team on other projects. </p>

				She also taught me about freelancing, the number one way for a graphic designer to go out and make a name for themselves while raking in some cash, so I did that too. I’ve always loved that aspect of the field, knowing that I never have to sit idly while someone decides whether or not I’ll work; I‘m always on the lookout for small projects, and the best part is that it’s fun to do. I love collaborating with clients, getting to understand their wants and needs, and then coming up with a solution for them that they’re happy with. I apply the creative process to so much more than just design in my life, because it’s foundation is built on the principles of innovation and problem solving, and ultimately those are my goals, not solely as a designer but also as a person. That’s the reason I’m passionate about the field of design and digital media, it’s a whole ‘nother platform in which design can manifest itself in any number of different ways. And finally, I love it for how its rapidly evolving, resulting in a wide variety of job opportunities encompassed in the field. It's all great. </p>
