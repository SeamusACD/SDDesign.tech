		<h3>Websites</h3>
		
		<a href="http://portersquarehandyman.com/" target="_blank"><h4>PorterSquareHandyman.com</h4></a>
			<p>The first site I chose was portersquarehandyman.com. There are several things 
			that I like about this site, but the first thing I'd say from an initial response 
			it that it seems like its lacking a polished finish on the interface. There doesn't 
			seem to be enough going on, which is funny because usually less is more, but in this 
			case where the website owner is a handyman you'd think they'd want to put more of 
			their work on display. The slideshow that constantly plays through on the front page 
			is okay, but it probably doesn't do the handyman's work justice. In addition to the 
			lack of space taken up on the page, I think the space that is taken up is done in a 
			not so great way. I think it's the way the information is stacked that gives it a 
			slightly unbalanced feel to it, but it also could be that three different fonts and 
			sizes are being used all on one page.</p>

			<p>As for what I like about the page. All the information is easily accessible. 
			The click thru links bring you right where you need to go. All the information on 
			those pages are also fairly easy to read, but again lacking in the structure. The 
			way the information is written makes it easy to understand the service thats being 
			offered, and lastly I like the features. Clicking through the site is very smooth. 
			The responsive interface makes it enjoyable to use.</p>

		<a href="http://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank"><h4>DaFont.com</h4></a>
			<p>The second site I focused on was dafont.com which is a site that offers royalty 
			free fonts. Aside from the awesome service this site offers, it's mainly just good 
			at getting the job done. While it may not be the pretties site, all the information 
			you need is very easy to find. It's actually all in one place at the top of every 
			pages. Since there isn't much else besides finding cool fonts and downloading them, 
			there isn't really much of a need for features. Everything you see is what you get 
			with this site. The only thing I wish it had was a place where you could test fonts 
			without downloading them. For example, a small text box next to them that would allow 
			you to write whatever you wanted in the font they have on display. This would allow 
			users who are picking stylized fonts just to write a word or a slogan the chance to 
			quickly try fonts without having to download them. The aspect of this site that I 
			like particularly is the simplicity in its use. The fact that it's not to glitzy makes 
			it much better and easier to navigate.</p>

		<a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/" target="_blank"><h4>Addicting</h4></a> 
			<p>The last site I chose was addictinggames.com. This site has a special place in my 
			heart. And, is a site I use to visit long before I thought I'd be writing a paragraph 
			on what makes it good or bad in my opinion. While it has gone through many changes over 
			the years, the site maintains the fun, addicting personality that can be felt in each 
			game. The site is completely stylized. I don't want to say it looks like an arcade, but 
			it almost has that feel. It offers a variety of games, and categories that you can choose 
			from which is something they execute very well in the design of the sites interface. 
			With the categories of each game on top, and other filters that can allow you to find 
			the hottest and most trending games, users are able to enjoy this site completely. 
			There aren't any super elaborate features but certain buttons do highlight and some 
			of the games even give brief descriptions when you put the cursor over them, which 
			is in my opinion another layer to UI design that adds positively to the experience.</p>
